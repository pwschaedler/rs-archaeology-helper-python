# RuneScape Archaeology Assistant

A small tool written in Python to help calculate useful quantities for materials and artefacts gathered from the archaeology skill in RuneScape.

## Planned Features

* List materials needed to restore an artefact.
* Aggregate needed materials over multiple types of artefacts and multiple numbers of the same artefact.
* Track how many materials a user has, calculate how many more are needed, and provide what the remaining porter charges will be after getting materials.
